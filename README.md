# online-cv

This repository contains the Vue.js files for my online CV accessible at [cyrill-martin.github.io](https://cyrill-martin.github.io).

The CV's content as well as the categories and values for the shown spider charts are maintained in the JSON file "myCv.json" in ``./src``. 

The charts are based on the D3.js code written in the "drawD3()" method in ``./src/components/stations/TheChart.vue``.
